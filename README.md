# Anthropology Report (Provenience Lab)

For an Archaeology course, I had to analyze data obtained from three excavation sites which had their own Pb-isotope signatures. From an unknown site, data about materials used in workshops that created decorative pieces and weapons (used as artifacts in this lab) was provided to us and we had to make inferences about where they obtained their raw materials from during different periods and determine trade routes between these excavation sites.
